They are the result of running the steps combineV1V3andV1V9GenusCounts() and combineV1V3andV1V9DownSampledGenusCounts()
from the original full_length_16S pipeline. 

Downsampling was done so that the same number of reads were available for V1V3 and V1V9 samples of the same individual. 
The number of reads is different across different individuals.
