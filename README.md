# weinstock_full_length_16s

This repository contains code used to perform the analysis reported in Johnson et al. 
'The 16S rRNA gene for species and strain-level microbiome analysis', which us currently
under review.

Code is organised into a set of [ruffus](http://www.ruffus.org.uk/) pipelines pertaining
to different figures. Each pipeline is designed to be run using a
[CGAT ruffus framework](https://github.com/cgat-developers/ruffus). The code
underlying Figures 1-3 is written in Python 2.7. The code underlying Figure 4 is written
in python 3.6 (pipeline_pb_strains) or 2.7 (pipeline_blast_16s).
